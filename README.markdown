Upskirt
=======

> The Markdown library that sucks less than your Markdown library

*	If your Markdown library is not standards compliant, Markdown is.

	Upskirt passes out of the box the official Markdown v1.0.0 and v1.0.3
	test suites, and has been extensively tested with additional corner cases
	to make sure its output is as sane as possible at all times.

*	If your Markdown library doesn't support Markdown extensions, Upskirt does.

	Upskirt has optional support for several (unofficial) Markdown extensions,
	such as non-strict emphasis, fenced code blocks, tables, autolinks,
	strikethrough and more.

*	If your Markdown library is ready to be used in production... No, nevermind,
	your Markdown library is not ready to be used in production.
	
	Upskirt is the only Markdown library ready to be used in a production environment
	where users can submit arbritrary and potentially malicious contents to render.

	Upskirt has been extensively security audited, and includes protection against
	all possible DOS attacks (stack overflows, out of memory situations, malformed
	Markdown syntax...) and against client attacks through malicious embedded HTML.

	We've worked very hard to make Upskirt never crash or run out of memory
	under *any* input. Upskirt renders all the Markdown content in GitHub and so
	far hasn't crashed a single time. 

*	If your Markdown library only does HTML, Upskirt does much more.

	Upskirt is not stuck with XHTML output: the Markdown parser of the library
	is decoupled from the renderer, so it's trivial to extend the library with
	custom renderers. A fully functional XHTML renderer is included.

*	If your Markdown library is slow, Upskirt is not.

	Upskirt is written in C, with a special emphasis on performance. When wrapped
	on a dynamic language such as Python or Ruby, it has shown to be up to 40
	times faster than other native alternatives.

*	If your Markdown library has retarded dependencies, Upskirt doesn't.

	Upskirt is a zero-dependency library composed of 3 `.c` files and their headers.
	No dependencies, no bullshit. Only standard C99 that builds everywhere.

This is a fork
--------------

The original `libupskirt` is the amazing work of Natacha Port√© and may be found
on its Fossil repository at:

We've created this fork of the library to focus on implementing extensive security fixes and
additional Markdown extensions which we believe are indispensable on a Markdown library
for the web. The original `libupskirt` backports some of these fixes, and we strongly
encourage you to check it out if you require a more UNIX-y Markdown library instead of one
aimed at the web.

None of this would be possible without Natacha's invaluable contributions, both when
writing the original library and when kindly reviewing and auditing the many changes
committed in this fork.

Henceforward she shall be known as the Lady of Markdown.

Help us
-------

Upskirt is all about security. If you find a (potential) security vulnerability in the library, or a way to make it crash
through malicious input, please report it to us, either directly via email or by opening an Issue on GitHub, and help
make the web safer for everybody.

Install
-------

There is nothing to install. Upskirt is composed of 3 `.c` files (`markdown.c`, `buffer.c` and `array.c`),
so just throw them in your project. Zero-dependency means zero-dependency. You might want to include `xhtml.c`
if you want to use the included XHTML renderer, or write your own renderer. Either way, it's all fun and joy.

If you are hardcore, you can use the included `Makefile` to build Upskirt into a static library, or to build
the sample `markdown` executable, which is just a commandline Markdown to XHTML parser.
